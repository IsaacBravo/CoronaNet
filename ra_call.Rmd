The CoronaNet project is an international effort of more than 500 researchers to collect data on a variety of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic for use by policy makers, academic researchers and others. You can read more about the project at [our website](http://www.coronanet-project.org) and our [core paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0909-7) published by Nature: Human Behaviour. The dataset, which captures already more than 25,000 policies, has already been used by government policy makers, academics and journalists, and we expect to be able to offer more thorough analysis of government responses (both determinants and effects) as we collect more data. The principal investigators for this project are:

Joan Barceló, New York University Abu Dhabi

Cindy Cheng, Hochschule für Politik at the Technical University of Munich

Allison Spencer Hartnett, Yale University

Robert Kubinec, New York University Abu Dhabi

Luca Messerschmidt, Hochschule für Politik at the Technical University of Munich

This project has already collected initial data on government responses for all countries in the world. *Because of the nature of the global pandemic, we are immediately sharing all data collected in this project with the aim of informing the broader public and stimulating research on the effects and causes of COVID-19 policies.* We have need of research assistants for the next several months to help us expand data collection to further categories and at sub-national levels, as well as keep our data up to date as countries relax and impose new restrictions. It is an excellent opportunity for those who want hands-on policy analysis. Research assistants also have the option of writing policy reports for their countries or interesting policy trends, which are then published on our website. Your name and bio will also appear in our published articles and on our website.

For those who are junior faculty/postdocs/PhD students, we are happy to consider collaboration in terms of academic publishing/writing. Please email us at admin@coronanet-project.org so we can learn more of your interest in the project/data.

In addition, we do have some needs for those who can volunteer to help with data engineering and visualization to make the dataset more easily available to others. If you would like to contribute in those areas, please fill out the form below and provide evidence of your experience in your CV.

This position is an unpaid, volunteer position. However, the position can be done remotely, and the hours are flexible. We ask the applicant to consider a commitment of five to ten hour per week commitment for three months, though we will consider situations in which applicants cannot do the full three months (please explain in the application). As such, it can be used as a summer internship as well. Training will be done remotely, and you will be expected to participate in weekly team meetings and our online team Slack channel, which will connect you with research assistants from all over the world. We will attempt to assign you to a country you are interested in or have language/expertise in, but we cannot guarantee it. 

*Applications will be processed on a rolling basis.*

To apply, please [use our online form](https://form.jotform.com/201172569499062). Any questions about the position can be directed to admin@coronanet-project.org.
