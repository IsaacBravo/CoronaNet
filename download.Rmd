1. **CoronaNet Database Version 1.0 (core)**

This [file](https://github.com/saudiwin/corona_tscs/tree/master/data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release.csv) contains variables from the CoronaNet government response project, representing national and sub-national policy event data from more than 190 countries since January 1st, 2020. The data include source links, descriptions, targets (i.e. other countries), the type and level of enforcement, and a comprehensive set of policy types. For more detail on this data, you can see our [codebook here](data/codebook/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).
