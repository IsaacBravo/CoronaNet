1. **CoronaNet Database BETA Version 1.0 (core)**

This [file](https://github.com/saudiwin/corona_tscs/tree/master/data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release.csv) contains variables from the CoronaNet government response project, representing national and sub-national policy event data from more than 140 countries since January 1st, 2020. The data include source links, descriptions, targets (i.e. other countries), the type and level of enforcement, and a comprehensive set of policy types. For more detail on this data, you can see our [codebook here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME).

2.  **CoronaNet Database BETA Version 1.0 (extended)** 

This [file](https://github.com/saudiwin/corona_tscs/tree/master/data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release_allvars.csv) contains the government response information from the core data along with the following datasets:

  + Tests from the CoronaNet testing database (see http://coronanet-project.org for more info);
  + Cases/deaths/recovered from the JHU data repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19);
  + Country-level covariates including GDP, V-DEM democracy scores, human rights indices, power-sharing indices, and press freedom indices from the Niehaus World Economics and Politics Dataverse (https://niehaus.princeton.edu/news/world-economics-and-politics-dataverse)
