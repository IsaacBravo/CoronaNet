# About CoronaNet {-}

Together with colleagues from the NYU Abu Dhabi and the Technical University of Munich, we are compiling a data set on government responses to the corona virus. Our main focus is to collect as much information as we can about the various fine-grained actions governments are taking to defeat the coronavirus. This includes not only gathering information about which governments are responding to the coronavirus, but who they are targeting the policies toward (e.g. other countries), how they are doing it (e.g. travel restrictions, banning exports of masks) and when they are doing it. We aim to make the data publicly available as soon as possible to help move forward social science research on COVID-19.
We are collaborating with over 70 Research Assistants all over the world who are helping all of us make government reactions and policies visible.

# Fine-grained and dyadic data {-}

The data will yield fine-grained information on 

* The level of government responding to the corona virus crisis (e.g. national, regional/state, local/municipal) 

* Specific actions taken (e.g. travel bans, investments in the public health sector, etc.)

* Geographical areas targeted by these measures 

* Who or what they are targeting (e.g. foreigners, ventilators)

* Compliance mechanisms (e.g., mandatory or voluntary) 

* Timing of policy responses.
