To whom it may concern,

The CoronaNet Research Project recognises Advait Arya for the
outstanding contribution as a Research Assistant (RA). We appreciate the
dedication and marvellous effort in volunteering for the project. Advait
Arya worked from 2020-04-24 to 2020-04-27 for the project. Advait Arya
coded and updated policies for Bangladesh and without this support, we
haven´t had more than 14.000 entries within a month.

CoronaNet Research Project compiles a database on government responses
to the COVID-19 crises. The primary objective is to collect as much
information as possible about the diverse actions governments are taking
to contain the coronavirus. This includes not only gathering information
about which governments are responding to the coronavirus, but who they
are targeting the policies toward (e.g.~other countries), how they are
doing it (e.g.~travel restrictions, banning exports of masks) and when
they are doing it. Together with over 250 political, social and public
health science scholars from all over the world, CoronaNet presents an
initial release of a comprehensive hand-coded dataset of more than
14,000 separate policy announcements from governments around the world
visible since December 31st 2019. For more information, see
www.coronanet-project.org

Advait Arya collected an amzing amount of policies and became a country
expert for Bangladesh. This role involved collecting and entering
government policies related to COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. It
involved classifying government policies in a Qualtrics database by
coding an online survey and following procedures outlined in the
Codebook.

Advait Arya has invested everything possible to support not only the
project but also collecting a dataset thatsupports policy makers and
scientists in real-time. We appreciate this exceptional solidarity and
thank Advait Arya for being part of this project.
