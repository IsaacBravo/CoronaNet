To whom it may concern,

The CoronaNet Research Project recognizes \textbf{Isak Jones} for their
outstanding contributions as a Research Assistant (RA). Isak Jones
worked from 2020-07-01 to 2020-07-17 for the project. Without their
support documenting and updating government policies in reaction to the
COVID-19 pandemic, CoronaNet would not have been able to provide
systematic and detailed information on how the government of different
countries responded to the pandemic. We appreciate the dedication and
incredible effort put into volunteering for this data collection effort
in a time of truly exceptional global uncertainty.

The CoronaNet Research Project collates data on government responses to
the COVID-19 crisis. Its primary objective is to collect as much
information as possible about the diverse actions governments are taking
to contain the spread and effects of COVID-19. This includes not only
gathering information about which governments are responding to the
coronavirus, but who they are targeting the policies toward (e.g.~other
countries), how they are doing it (e.g.~travel restrictions, banning
exports of masks) and when they are doing it. Together with over 300
political, social and public health science scholars from all over the
world, CoronaNet makes publicly available an initial release of a
comprehensive hand-coded dataset of more than 17,000 separate policy
announcements from governments around the world visible since December
31st 2019. For more information, see \url{www.coronanet-project.org}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Isak Jones collected an impressive number of policies and became a
  country expert for different countries. To fulfill this role, Isak
  Jones participated in our online training session, identified
  information on government policies made in response to COVID-19 from
  various information sources including government websites and
  newspaper articles and documented the government policies that they
  found following the procedures and classification scheme outlined in
  the
  \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME/edit?usp=sharing}{CoronaNetCodebook}.
  They further contributed to the CoronaNet community by posting and
  reading questions and comments on the CoronaNet Slack channel and
  participating in CoronaNet's weekly RA Zoom meetings.
\item
  Policy Checker: The RA evaluated the completeness of our dataset on
  some policies across several countries by taking into account other
  data sources.
\end{itemize}

Isak Jones has invested substantial time and effort in collecting
up-to-date information of great value to policy makers, scientists and
the global community. We appreciate them for their exceptional sense of
solidarity and their contribution to this important public good and are
deeply thankful to Isak Jones for being part of this project.
