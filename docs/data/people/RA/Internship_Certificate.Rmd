To whom it may concern, 

&nbsp;
Tong XU has been interning with us since May 20th and is planning to conduct a unpaid three months internship.

The CoronaNet Research Project collates data on government responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Its primary objective is to collect as much information as possible about the diverse actions governments are taking to contain the spread and effects of COVID-19. This includes not only gathering information about which governments are responding to the coronavirus, but who they are targeting the policies toward (e.g. other countries), how they are doing it (e.g. travel restrictions, banning exports of masks) and when they are doing it. Together with over 300 political, social and public health science scholars from all over the world, CoronaNet makes publicly available an initial release of a comprehensive hand-coded dataset of more than 17,000 separate policy announcements from governments around the world visible since December 31st 2019. For more information, see [www.coronanet-project.org](www.coronanet-project.org).
 
As a volunteer and Research Assistant Intern, Tong XU will be assisting us in several areas : (1) researching what government policies his assigned country has implemented starting from the beginning of the epidemic, (2) keeping up to date with new government policy actions on a daily basis and (3) Writing country reports or creating visualizations. 
 
Tong XU will be working 20 hours a week and this work can be done remotely. We are looking forward to a productive summer with him.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me: luca.messerschmidt@hfp.tum.de (004915736905422)
 
Sincerely,
