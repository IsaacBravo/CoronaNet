# Governmental Responses towards COVID-19 {-}

The CoronaNet COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Database provides fine-grained, dyadic data on policy actions taken by governments across the world since the Chinese government reported the COVID-19 outbreak on December 31, 2019. The dataset presented here covers all policy actions for 191 countries up until April 9 2020, for a total of 5342 events. 

The rapid and devastating spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has put in stark relief the previously invisible connections among different countries and people. Our dataset illuminates a countervailing kind of network --- it documents not only what actions governments have taken against COVID-19, but how these actions have targeted other geographical regions and the people and resources within them over time. The data, which is publicly available, will allow us to understand among other things, how the effectiveness of different government policies may vary over time or depending on policy actions taken by other governments. 

More specifically, the CoronaNet database collects data on government policy actions taken against the coronavirus across the following dimensions and tracks them over time:

+ The type of government policy implemented (e.g. quarantine, closure of schools [15 total] )
+ The level of government initiating the action (e.g. national, provincial, municipal etc.)
+ The geographical target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. national, provincial, municipal etc.)
+ The human or material target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. travlers, ventilators)
+ The directionality of the policy action, if applicable (e.g., inbound, outbound, both)
+ The mechanism of travel that the policy action targets, if applicable (e.g. flights, trains)
+ The compliance with the policy action (e.g. mandatory, volulntary)
+ The timing of the policy action (e.g. date announced, date implemented)

In what follows, we describe in greater detail the methodology we employed to collect this data, a description of the data, and also the application of our data in modeling the stringency of measures over time. Using a Bayesian dynamic item-response theory model, we produce a statistically-valid index that ranks countries in terms of their reponse to the pandemic, and also shows how quickly policy responses have changed over time.
