## CoronaNet Government Response Database: A Dyadic, Hand-Coded Dataset of World-wide Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic {-}

In this paper we present an initial release of a large hand-coded dataset of more than 5,000 separate policy announcements from governments around the world. The data are being made publicy available, in combination with COVID-19 testing data and country-level covariates. Due to the speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will be releasing this data on a daily basis with a 5-day lag for record validity checking. We believe this to be one of the largest and fastest manual data collection projects to date in political science, employing more than 150 research assistants across 18 time zones and making use of cloud-based managerial and data collection technology in addition to machine learning coding of news sources. We analyze the dataset with a Bayesian time-varying ideal point model showing the quick acceleration of more harsh policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. While some relatively low-cost policies like task forces and health monitoring began early, countries generally adopted more harsh measures within a narrow time window, giving indication of strong policy diffusion effects.

## Observed COVID-19 Test and Case Counts {-}

As the COVID-19 outbreak increases, increasing numbers of researchers are examining how an array of factors either hurt or help the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, the majority of available data, primarily confirmed cases of COVID-19, are widely known to be biased indicators of the spread of the disease. In this paper I present a retrospective Bayesian model that is much simpler than epidemiological models of disease progression but is still able to identify the effect of covariates on the historical infection rate. I show that while observed cases and test counts cannot be used to measure the true infection rate due to confounding between the infection rate and the observed data, it is possible to use informative priors derived from susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models to estimate associations between background factors and the disease. The model is validated by comparing estimation of the count of infected to projections from expert surveys and extant disease forecasts. To apply the model, I show that as of April 7th, higher infection rates are increasingly concentrated in U.S. states with smaller economies, larger youth populations, less public health funding and fewer Trump voters. On the other hand, the percentage of foreign born residents, air quality, and the number of smokers and cardiovascular deaths are not clear predictors of COVID-19 trends.
